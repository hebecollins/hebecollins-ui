PRIORITY HIGH:
* after editing remarks, button are getting disappeared permanently. FIX THIS!

PRIORITY MODERATE:
* make certain pages inaccessible if client is not selected
* remove client data if any other page is accessed other than workout related pages accessibility of page/route
  must be handled outside of a component(can be done in redirect section)
* upgrade webpack version to at least 2.0

PRIORITY LOW:
* make save and assign workout option
* make gymId store as a seperate entry and make it open for user to change it
* let trainers and managers categorize their client. There should be a separate button in it to see by category.

NEW FEATURE IDEAS :
* make an option in manager interface where he/she can see the list of people with pending fees.
* user should get notification when his fees is pending.
